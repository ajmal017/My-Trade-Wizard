My Trade Wizard is an open-source platform for automating trading systems.  It targets the Interactive Brokers API, and supports stocks & futures.  There are 3 main components:

- [**Core Library**](https://github.com/zskolnik/My-Trade-Wizard/tree/master/Core%20Library): is a Ruby gem that defines a Domain Specific Language for creating your own trading systems, and provides them with market data & execution capabilities.

- [**Interactive Brokers GUI automation**](https://github.com/zskolnik/My-Trade-Wizard/tree/master/Interactive%20Brokers%20GUI%20automation): is an AutoIt script for automating the Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation on Windows.

- [**Sample Trading Systems**](https://github.com/zskolnik/My-Trade-Wizard/tree/master/Sample%20Trading%20Systems): contains examples of automated trading systems built using the Core Library.  There is an example that trades [*Bitcoin Futures*](https://github.com/zskolnik/My-Trade-Wizard/tree/master/Sample%20Trading%20Systems/Bitcoin%20Futures), and an example that trades a [*Stock Watchlist*](https://github.com/zskolnik/My-Trade-Wizard/tree/master/Sample%20Trading%20Systems/Stock%20Watchlist).
